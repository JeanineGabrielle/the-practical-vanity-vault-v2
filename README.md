# 💄 The Practical Vanity Vault

**Helping you justify your next skincare haul!**  
A minimalist inventory manager for skincare and cosmetics lovers who want to stay organized without losing the joy of collecting serums. 🌸  

---

### ✨ What It Does
- 🧴 Track your skincare and makeup products  
- 📦 Manage batches (opened / unopened, quantities, expiry tracking)  
- 🌙 Toggle between light and dark mode  
- 📉 Get low-stock alerts and PAO reminders  
- 💾 Back up data locally with **Save My Shelf**  
- ☁️ Sync securely to the cloud with Firebase — so your collection follows you to any device  
- 📤 Export CSV or JSON for manual backups or migration  

---

### 💬 Data & Privacy
Your inventory is **private to you**.  
- Data lives in your **browser** unless you sign in for cloud sync.  
- When you sign in with Google, your inventory is stored in your **private Firestore document** — no one else can access it.  
- No ads, no analytics, no nonsense. Just your products, safe and organized. 💅  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> If you clear your browser history, cache, or site data, your local vault will vanish (like a discontinued serum 🫠).  
> Always use **Save My Shelf**, **Export JSON**, or **Sign in with Google** to back up your data.  
>
> 🧴 *Protect your stash before you clear your cache!* 💅
